# Selected-areas-in-Communications-Networks

This course is a follow-up from the first Netwwork Protocols course and provides a survey of contemporary topics in 
communication networks. In Spring 2022, these topics will include software defined 
networking, network data analytics, network management (and its automation), and 
techniques for providing latency and throughput guarantees to traffic classes using rate 
limiting devices and link sharing schedulers.
